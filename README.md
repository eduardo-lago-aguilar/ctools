Low level routines to access video memory and control some PC functions

*CTOOLS* a.k.a. CGA-Tools was born around 1995, about that time we were teenagers and we had our own game building garage. 

CTOOLS is written in Assembler and Pascal language, and helped us to build a few game titles back in the days. Including *Glooby*, *Tin-Ton* and *Elpidio Valdes*.

Back from the graveyard we brought you this nostalgic chunk of code, it is a great feeling to look back and compare your coding skills with yourself 25 years ago!

Have fun from the CTools contributors!
